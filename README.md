# 📜 Selenium Basics
I was so eager to learn selenium in the first place and I got to learn it now. Presenting a small - **bit sized reference book** for those who are just starting out with selenium.

## ℹ️ About the repository
This repository contains the **jupyter** books with ***human redable*** concepts. As usual it is made with care in minimalist language and to-the-point explanation.

## 🧭 Navigation
There is a folder "referance_images" which contains the images used in the books. So you might don't want to look there. **Start** with the `1.` book and go from there in sequence till `7.`. 

Thanks!
